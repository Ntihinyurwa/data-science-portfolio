# Database Design & Advanced SQL Analytics

## Overview
This project focuses on relational database design, dimensional modeling, and advanced SQL analytics used to support business reporting and decision-making.

The work demonstrates strong foundations in data modeling, normalization, SQL querying, and analytics-ready data preparation.

## Business Problem
Organizations rely on well-designed databases to:
- Ensure data consistency and integrity  
- Support efficient analytical queries  
- Enable accurate reporting across business functions  

This project addresses these needs through structured database design and advanced SQL-based analysis.

## Solution Approach
- Designed relational schemas using ERD and Crow’s Foot notation  
- Applied normalization and business rules to improve data quality  
- Implemented advanced SQL queries for analytics and reporting  
- Used window functions and aggregation techniques to analyze trends  

## Key Concepts & Skills
- Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)  
- Dimensional Modeling (Star Schema concepts)  
- Advanced SQL Analytics  
- Data Integrity & Normalization  
- Reporting-Oriented Query Design  

## SQL Techniques Demonstrated
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, LAG, LEAD, NTILE)  
- Aggregations (ROLLUP, GROUPING SETS)  
- Set Operations (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT)  

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL Server
- MySQL
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
- Draw.io (ERD & Dimensional Diagrams)


## Status
🚧 *In progress* — SQL scripts, ERD diagrams, and analytical queries will be added as the project is finalized.
