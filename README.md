## 👋 Hi there, Vincent de Paul Ntihinyurwa

🎓 **M.S. in Data Analytics & Information Systems** — Texas State University  
🏅 **Graduated with a 4.0 GPA**  
📍 Austin, TX  

## About Me

I am a data analytics graduate with a strong foundation in **data modeling and dimensional modeling**, statistical analysis, machine learning, and business analytics. I recently completed my Master’s degree in Data Analytics & Information Systems at Texas State University, graduating with a perfect 4.0 GPA.

I gained hands-on industry experience through a graduate internship at **McCoy’s Building Supply**, where I worked on real-world analytics problems including **price optimization**, **market basket analysis**, **customer behavior modeling**, and **business impact analysis** using large-scale transactional data.

I specialize in building data pipelines, transforming raw data into analytics-ready datasets, and delivering insights that support business decision-making. My experience spans data engineering, analytics, and business intelligence, supported by strong skills in Python, SQL, and cloud-based data platforms.
