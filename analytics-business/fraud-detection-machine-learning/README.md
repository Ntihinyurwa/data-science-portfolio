# Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions within large-scale financial datasets.

The focus is on handling class imbalance, improving recall for minority classes, and evaluating model performance in a business-risk context.

## Business Problem
Fraudulent transactions can result in:
- Financial loss
- Operational inefficiencies
- Increased regulatory risk

Accurate fraud detection systems must balance precision and recall while remaining scalable and interpretable.

## Solution Approach
- Performed exploratory and diagnostic analysis on transaction-level data
- Engineered features to capture transaction patterns
- Trained and evaluated multiple classification models
- Addressed class imbalance using resampling techniques

## Models & Techniques
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Boosting Models
- Neural Networks
- SMOTE & Undersampling
- Model evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Model Evaluation Metrics

## Status
🚧 *In progress* — notebooks, model pipelines, and evaluation results will be added.
