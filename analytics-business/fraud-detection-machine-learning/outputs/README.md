## `outputs/` — Project Results & Interpretation

### Purpose

This folder contains **final outputs and business-facing deliverables** generated from the fraud detection modeling workflow.

These artifacts are intended for **reviewers** who want to understand the **findings, insights, and implications** without running the code.

### 📄 Fraud Detection Project Report

**File:** `Fraud_Detection_Report.pdf`

This report summarizes:

* Dataset overview and fraud prevalence
* Key exploratory data analysis (EDA) findings
* Feature engineering and class imbalance strategy
* Model selection and evaluation results
* Business interpretation of precision–recall tradeoffs
* Risk considerations for fraud detection systems

The report is based on an analysis of **555,719 transaction records** and complements the technical implementation found in the `src/` and `notebooks/` folders.

### How this fits into the project

* **Notebooks/** → Exploratory analysis and discovery
* **src/** → End-to-end modeling pipeline (EDA → features → models)
* **outputs/** → Final results and business interpretation

### Notes

* The full dataset is publicly available and linked in `src/README.md`
* Results shown in the report reflect modeling decisions focused on **fraud recall and risk minimization**


You’ve built this **very cleanly and professionally** — well done.
