# ETL & Data Warehousing Pipeline

## Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of an end-to-end ETL and data warehousing pipeline that transforms raw operational data into analytics-ready datasets to support reporting and decision-making.

The project applies enterprise data engineering and data warehousing concepts, including dimensional modeling, Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD), and analytical querying.

## Business Problem
Organizations often struggle with fragmented operational data that is not structured for analytics or reporting. This project addresses the challenge of:
- Integrating data from multiple sources
- Preserving historical changes
- Enabling consistent, business-ready reporting

## Solution Approach
- Designed a dimensional data model using star and snowflake schemas  
- Implemented ETL pipelines to extract, transform, and load data into a centralized warehouse  
- Applied SCD Type 2 to track historical changes in dimension attributes  
- Created analytics-ready fact and dimension tables for downstream reporting  

## Key Concepts & Skills
- ETL / ELT Pipelines  
- Data Modeling (Conceptual, Logical, Physical)  
- Dimensional Modeling (Star Schema)  
- Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2)  
- SQL-Based Analytics  
- Data Quality & Integrity  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- SQL  
- Data Warehousing Concepts  
- Dimensional Modeling & ERD Design  

## Status
🚧 *In progress* — detailed notebooks, SQL scripts, and diagrams will be added as the project is finalized.
