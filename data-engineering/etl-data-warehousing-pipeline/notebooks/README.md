# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, transformation logic, and validation steps within the ETL pipeline.

Notebooks here demonstrate:
- Data profiling and quality checks  
- Transformation logic before loading into the warehouse  
- Validation of fact and dimension tables  

🚧 *Notebooks will be added as the pipeline implementation progresses.*
