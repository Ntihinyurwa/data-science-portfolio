# Price Optimization & Market Basket Analytics
## Data Availability & Confidentiality
Due to data confidentiality policies, the original transaction-level dataset and SQL extracts used in this project cannot be shared publicly.

This repository focuses on:
- The analytical approach and modeling logic
- Reproducible Python code used for market basket analysis and pricing simulation
- Documentation of assumptions, methodology, and business impact

Where appropriate, example inputs or synthetic data may be used to demonstrate functionality.

## Overview
This project focuses on applying analytics and data-driven modeling techniques to understand customer purchasing behavior, identify product relationships, and support pricing and revenue optimization decisions.

The analysis is based on transaction-level retail data and emphasizes practical business impact through simulation and scenario analysis.

## Business Problem
Retail organizations face challenges in:
- Understanding cross-product purchasing behavior  
- Identifying key driver items that influence basket value  
- Evaluating pricing strategies without disrupting demand  

This project addresses these challenges by combining market basket analysis with pricing simulations to support informed decision-making.

## Solution Approach
- Performed exploratory and diagnostic analysis on transaction-level data  
- Applied market basket and co-occurrence analysis to identify product relationships  
- Built pricing simulation models to evaluate “what-if” scenarios  
- Translated analytical results into actionable business insights
